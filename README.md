## 2 New Features


1. `Calculation columns`, these are columns in the table that are populated based on a user defined formula e.g. A cell count column that is created by the formula: `Cell Density * Volume` 
  - Using the add columns button users can add another column by an equation defined by the user.
  - The Colums are referred to as c1 for the first column and so on.
   
2.  A `Column Aggregations` feature which allows a user to perform operations on a selected data column, such as showing the `Maximum Density`, `Minimum Cell Count`, etc...
  - Select a column and right click. 
  - A Dialog will open with the minimum, maximum and average values for the column.

## Further Improvements
  - Have some functionality to delete columns.
  - Generalise the App so that any format of data can be used.
  - Improve the 'Column Aggerations' so it works on some highlighted cells, not just the whole column. Maybe base the sub columns on time values.

## How to have 'rate of ' calculations
Would implement rate of change = Δx / Δy = (x_2 − x_1)/(y_2−y_1) ​where the y would be the time column and x would be the quantity of interest. Would be a special case of the calculation column.
